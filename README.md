##Project Introduction:
This project is to design a website for a training motion tracker. This training motion tracker is used by people who want to monitor their movement while training, such as 
bench press, dead lift or squat. The webstie is for exhibiting purpose mainly. It will show the design of this product, how it will be used and related information in terms of
CMF(Color, Manufacturing, Finish).

##Basic features:
- **Scroll-Based 3D Animation** – The product rotates and is revealed dynamically as the user scrolls through the page.
- **Scroll-Triggered Storytelling** – The website highlights key product benefits through a narrative-style scroll layout.
- **Interactive Form Test** – Users can drag a virtual barbell in an exercise animation (bench press, squat, or deadlift) to test form. An embedded ML model will verify whether the movement is correct or not.
- **Responsive and Modern Design** – Built for both desktop and mobile browsers, with a clean and immersive UI.
