## Project Introduction
This project is to design a website for a training motion tracker. This training motion tracker is used by people who want to monitor their movement while training, such as bench press, dead lift or squat. The website is for exhibiting purpose mainly. It will show the design of this product, how it will be used and related information in terms of CMF (Color, Manufacturing, Finish).

## Target User
Training beginners and gym enthusiasts

## Basic features
- **Scroll-Based 3D Animation** – The product rotates and is revealed dynamically as the user scrolls through the page.
- **Scroll-Triggered Storytelling** – The website highlights key product benefits through a narrative-style scroll layout.
- **Interactive Form Test** – Users can drag a virtual barbell in an exercise animation (bench press, squat, or deadlift) to test form. An embedded ML model will verify whether the movement is correct or not.
- **Responsive and Modern Design** – Built for both desktop and mobile browsers, with a clean and immersive UI.

## Timeline

# Next.js Project Instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
